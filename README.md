# Online-Folder-Backup
Online Folder Backup is a distributed-system project implemented by Java.  
The aim of this project is to allow users to syncronize files from one folder to another remote folder by defining IP addresses and port numbers of two folders. 
TCP/IP sockets are used to communicate between server and client. 
With two jar files, users can delete, modify, add the files of FROM folder on client side, the relative changes will be made in TO folder on server side.
